# FastEndpoints CamelCasing

Trying to find out if camelcasing in the transition from `v5.18` to `v5.19+` has been compromised on FastEndpoints.
This is documented at https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/issues/633.
The issue focusses on the CamelCasing Strategy conversion with the output shown here: https://github.com/EelcoLos/FastEndpoints.CamelCase/blob/500bc505f3c5f5723237d59e60687001d6668aeb/specification.json#L70C18-L70C20
